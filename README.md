# Minishell
This project is about creating a bash shell. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.
you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when modern OS's didn’t exist.

## Mendatory Part
Here are the requirements of this 42 Network project:
| Field                  | Description
|------------------------|-----------------
| **Program name**       | minishell
| **Required files**     | Makefile, *.h, *.c
| **Makefile**           | NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
| **Arguments**          | (None)
| **External functions** | readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line, rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history, printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read, close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit, getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir, strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl, getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs
| **Description**        | Simply write a shell

Your shell should:
* Display a **prompt** when waiting for a new command.
* Have a working **history**.
* Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
* Not use more than **one global variable**. Think about it. You will have to explain its purpose.
* Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
* Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.
* • Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
* Implement **redirections**:
	* < should redirect input.
	* \> should redirect output.
	* << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
	* \>\> should redirect output in append mode.
* Implement **pipes** (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
* Handle **environment variables** ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
* Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
* Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
* In interactive mode:
	* ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	* ctrl-D exits the shell.
	* ctrl-\ does nothing.
* Your shell must implement the following **builtins**:
	* echo with option -n
	* cd with only a relative or absolute path
	* pwd with no options
	* export with no options
	* unset with no options
	* env with no options or arguments
	* exit with no options

The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You don’t have to fix them. But that **doesn’t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have memory leaks**.

## Bonus Part
Your program has to implement:
	* && and || with parenthesis for priorities.
## Optional
    subshell
